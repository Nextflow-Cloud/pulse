# Pulse

## Description
Pulse is a WebRTC voice node for Harmony. Under the hood, it is a SFU (selective forwarding unit) that allows for multiple users to connect to a single voice channel and communicate with each other in real time. It is built from the Rust WebRTC implementation [webrtc-rs](https://github.com/webrtc-rs/webrtc). It seamlessly connects with the Harmony core server using Redis.
